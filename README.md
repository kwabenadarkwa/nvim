# My Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! üöÄ

This setup includes plugins for enhancing your Neovim experience, including:

- [alpha](https://github.com/gcmt/alpha.nvim): A Lua API wrapper for Neovim UI.
- [catppuccino](https://github.com/palenikk/Catppuccino.nvim): A beautiful and vibrant color scheme.
- [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim): A highly extendable fuzzy finder.
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter): A Lua powered incremental parser for Neovim.
- ... and many more you can check out in the lua/plugins directory. 

# Configuring

To use my configuration, follow these steps:
You have to have neovim installed first btw 
1. Clone this repository to your Neovim configuration directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
   ```
- NB: If you already have an nvim in your .config directory, you would have to remove it before running ‚òùÔ∏è

2. Launch neovim by running this in the terminal:
   ```bash
     nvim 
   ```
3. When neovim opens it should start installing the plugins automatically using lazy. I think there are some things you might have to install your self from github but I can't remember them so when that happens lmk.
